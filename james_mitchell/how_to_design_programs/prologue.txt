To program is to write down an arithmetic expression, but you’re no longer
restricted to boring numbers. In BSL, arithmetic is the arithmetic of numbers,
strings, Booleans, and even images. To compute, though, still means to determine
the value of an expression—except that this value can be a string, a number,
a Boolean, or an image.


First, (define (FunctionName InputName) BodyExpression)is a function definition.
You recognize it as such because it starts with the “define” keyword.

Second, (FunctionName ArgumentExpression) is a function application.
The first part tells DrRacket which function you wish to use. The second part
is the input to which you want to apply the function.
