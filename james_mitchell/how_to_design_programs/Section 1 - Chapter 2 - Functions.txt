Definitions While many programming languages obscure the relationship between
programs and functions, BSL brings it to the fore. Every BSL program consists of
 several definitions, usually followed by an expression that involves those
 definitions. There are two kinds of definitions:

constant definitions, of the shape (define Variable Expression), which we
encountered in the preceding chapter; and

function definitions, which come in many flavors, one of which we used in the
Prologue.

Like expressions, function definitions in BSL come in a uniform shape:
(define (FunctionName Variable ... Variable)
  Expression)
