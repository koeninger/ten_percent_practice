A good programcomes with a short write-up that explains what it does, what inputs it expects, and what it produces 

programming product: the program's connection to the problem statement is evident so that a small change to the problem statement is easy to
translate into a small change to the program 

Exercise 33: research the "year 2000" problem
Y2K problem, Millennium bug, Y2K bug
was a class of computer bugs related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning the year 2000
problems arose or were anticipated because many programs repsresent 4-digit years with only the final 2 digits making the 
2000 year indistinguishable from 1900 

3.1 Designing Functions

the purpose of a program is to describe a computational process that consumes some information and produces new information
think of information as facts about the program's domain 
for a program to process information it must turn the information into some form of data in the programming language, then
process the data, and then turn the resulting data into information again 
an interactive program may even intermingle these steps by acquiring more information from the world as needed and delivering 
information in between 

model view controller (MVC) the way BSL and DrRacket separate data processing from parsing information into data and turning 
data into information 

program design must start with the connection between information and data and we should decide how to use our chosen programming
language to represent the relevant pieces of information as data and how we should interpret data as information 

Designing a program that consumes and produces information inf the form of numbers, an interpreetation requires explaining what
a number as 42 denotes in the domain: 
42 could refer to # of pixels from top margin in the domain of images
42 could mean a temperature
etc. 
the key is to know how to go from numbers as information to numbers as data and vice versa

data definitions: write down this knowledge in the form of comments and serves 2 purposes:
names a collection of data, a class, using a meaningful word
informs readres how to crete elements of this class and how to decide whether some arbitrary piece of data belongs to the collection
Example:
; A Temperature is a Number.
; interpretation represents Celsius degrees 

The Design Process: 
1. Express how you wish to represent the information as data
; We use numbers to represent centimeters.
formulate data definitions, like the one for Temperature, for the classes of data that are considered critical for the program

2. write down a signature, statement of purpose, and a function header
function signature: a comment that tells the readers of the design how many inputs the function consumers, which classes they
draw from, and what kind of data it produces
; String -> Number
; Temperature -> String
