constant definitions (define Variable Expression) 
function definitions (define FunctionName Variable ... Variable) Expression)
  (define (
  the name of the function
  followed by several variables, separated by space and ending in )
  and an expression followed by (
function application puts defined functions to work and looks just like the applications of a pre-defined operation
  write (
  write down the name of a defined function f,
  write down as many arguments as f consumes, separated by space, 
  and add ) at the end

Exercise 11 Define a function that consumers two numbers x and y, and that compuates the distance of point (x, y) to the origin
(define x 3)
(define y 4)
(define (distance x y) (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))

Exercise 12 Define the function cvolume which accepts the lenght of a side of an equilateral cube and compuetes its volume
(define (cvolume x) (* x x x))
if you have time consider defining csurface
(define (csurface x) (* 6 (* x x)))
