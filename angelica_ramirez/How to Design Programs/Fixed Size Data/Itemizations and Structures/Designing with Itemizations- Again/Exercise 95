Defining Itemizations The first step in our design recipes calls for the development of data definitions. One purpose of a 
data definition is to describe the construction of data that represents the state of the world; another is to describe all 
possible pieces of data that the event-handing functions of the world program consume. 
The space invader game with a missile-firing tank requires a data representation for two different kinds of game states.

; physical constants
(define WIDTH 200)
(define HEIGHT 200)

; graphical constants
(define UFO (overlay
             (rectangle 20 2 "solid" "purple")
             (ellipse 15 10 "solid" "purple")))


(define TANK (rectangle 15 10 "solid" "olive"))
(define TANK-HEIGHT (image-height TANK))
(define TANK-Y (- HEIGHT (/ TANK-HEIGHT 2)))

(define MISSILE (rectangle 1 15 "solid" "red"))

(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "black"))

; a mock up
(define MOCK-UP
  (place-image MISSILE 140 (- HEIGHT 120)
               (place-image TANK 100 TANK-Y
                            (place-image UFO 150 (- HEIGHT 160)
                                         BACKGROUND))))

(define-struct aim [ufo tank]) ;; the time period when the player is trying to get the tank in position for a shot
(define-struct fired [ufo tank missile]) ;; representing states after the missile is fired

; A UFO is a Posn
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the UFO's location
; (using the top-down, left-to-right convention)

(define-struct tank [loc vel])
; A Tank is a structure:
;   (make-tank Number Number).
; interpretation (make-tank x dx) specifies the position:
; (x, HEIGHT) and the tank's speed: dx pixels/tick

; A Missile is a Posn
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the missile's place

; A SIGS is one of:
; - (make-aim UFO Tank)
; - (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
; interpretation represents the complete state of a space invader game

(define AIM1
  (make-aim (make-posn 20 10) (make-tank 28 -3))) ; tank maneuvering into position to fire the missile

(define FIRED1
  (make-fired (make-posn 20 10) 
            (make-tank 28 -3)
            (make-posn 28 (- HEIGHT TANK-HEIGHT)))) ; like the previous one but misile has been fired

(define FIRED2
  (make-fired (make-posn 20 100)
            (make-posn 100 3)
            (make-posn 22 103))) ; the missile is about to collide with the UFO
            
Exercise 95 Explain why the three instances are generated according to the first or second clause of the data definition 
; AIM1 is generated according to first clause since it calls for a posn and tank
; FIRED1 and FIRED2 are generated accordign to second clause since it involves a posn, tank and missile
