Exercise 98 Design the function si-game-over? for use as the stop-when handler. 
The game stops if the UFO Lands or if the missile hits the UFO. For both conditions, we recommend that you check
for the proximity of one object to another.
The stop-when clause allows for an optional second sub-expression, namely a function that renders the final state of the game.
Design si-render-final and use it as the second part for your stop-when clause in the main function of exercise 100.
