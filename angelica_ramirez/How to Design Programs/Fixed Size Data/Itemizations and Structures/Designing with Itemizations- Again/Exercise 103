; Exercise 103 Develop a data representation for the following four kinds of zoo animals
; (spiders, elephants, boa constrictors, armadillos)
; Develop a template for functions that consume zoo animals
; Design the fits? function, which consumes a zoo animals and a description of a cage
; It determines whether the cage's volume is large engough for the animal

(define-struct spider [legs space])
; A Spider is a structure:
;   (make-spider Number Number)
; interpretation the number of remaining legs
; and the space needed in case of transport 

(define-struct elephant [space])
; An Elephant is a structure:
;    (make-elephant Number)
; interpretation specifies the space needed in case of transport

(define-struct boa-constrictor [length girth])
; A boa-constrictor is a structure:
;   (make-boa-constrictor Number Number)
; interpretation the length of the boa-constrictor
; and the girth or circumference of boa-constrictor

(define-struct armadillo [length space])
; An armadillo is a structure
;    (make-armadillo Number Number)
; interpretation is the lenght of armadillo
; and space needed in case of transport
