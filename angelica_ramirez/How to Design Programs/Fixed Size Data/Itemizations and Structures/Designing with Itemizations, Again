Exercise 94 Use sample problem from exercise 74 in "programming with structures"
Draw some sketches of what the game scenery looks like at various stages and use them to determine the constant
and the variable pieces of the game. Develop physical and graphical constants that describe the dimensions of the world 
and its objects. Create the initial scene from the constants for the tank, the UFO, and the background. 

; physical constants
(define WIDTH 200)
(define HEIGHT 200)

; graphical constants
(define UFO (overlay
             (rectangle 20 2 "solid" "purple")
             (ellipse 15 10 "solid" "purple")))


(define TANK (rectangle 15 10 "solid" "olive"))
(define TANK-Y (- HEIGHT (/ (image-height TANK) 2)))

(define MISSILE (rectangle 1 15 "solid" "red"))

(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "black"))

; a mock up
(define MOCK-UP
  (place-image MISSILE 140 (- HEIGHT 120)
               (place-image TANK 100 TANK-Y
                            (place-image UFO 150 (- HEIGHT 160)
                                         BACKGROUND))))
