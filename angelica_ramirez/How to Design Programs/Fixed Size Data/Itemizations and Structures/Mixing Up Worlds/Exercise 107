Exercise 107 Design the cham-and-cat program, which deals with both a virtual cat and a virtual chameleon. You need
a data definition for a "zoo" containing both animals and functions for dealing with it.
The problem statement leaves open how keys manipulate the two animals. Here are two possible interpretations
1. each key event goes to both animals
2. each key event aplies to only one of the two animals 
Choose one of the alternatives and design the appropriate program
