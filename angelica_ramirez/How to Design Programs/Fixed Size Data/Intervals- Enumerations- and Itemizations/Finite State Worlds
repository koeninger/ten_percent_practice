Exercise 60: An Alternative data representation for a traffic light program may use numbers instead of strings: 
  ; An N-TrafficLight is one of:
  ; - 0 interpretation the traffic light shows red
  ; - 1 interpretation the traffic light shows green
  ; - 2 interpretation the traffic light shows yellow
  
  It greatly simlifies the definition of tl-next:

  ; yields the next state, given current state cs
  (define (tl-next-numeric cs) (modulo (+ cs 1) 3)) 
  
  Reformulate the tl-nexts's tests for tl-next-numeric
