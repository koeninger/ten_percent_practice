Sample Problem: Design a program that simultes the descent of a UFO
;; A WorldState is a Number
;; intepretation number of pixels between the top and the UFO

(define WIDTH 300); distances in terms of pixels
(define HEIGHT 100)
(define CLOSE (/ HEIGHT 3))
(define MTSCN (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define UFO (overlay (circle 10 "solid" "green") (rectangle 40 2 "solid" "green"))) 

; WorldState -> WorldState
(define (main y0)
  (big-bang y0
    [on-tick nxt]
    [to-draw render]))

; WorldState -> WorldState
; computes next location of UFO
(check-expect (nxt 11) 14)
(define (nxt y)
  (+ y 3))

; WorldState -> Image
; places UFO at given height into the center of MTSCN
(check-expect (render 11) (place-image UFO (/ WIDTH 2) 11 MTSCN))
(define (render y)
  (place-image UFO (/ WIDTH 2) y MTSCN))
  
;;Sample Problem: Add a Status Line. It says "descending" when the UFOs height is above 1/3 
;;of the height of the canvas. "closing in" below that. And when UFO has reached the bottom
;;of the canvas, the status notifies the player that the UFO has "landed"

;; WorldState -> Image
;; add a status line to the scene create by render

(check-expect (render/status 10) (place-image (text "descending" 14 "green")
                                  30 20
                                  (render 10)))
(check-expect (render/status 50) (place-image (text "closing in" 14 "yellow")
                                  30 20
                                  (render 50)))
(check-expect (render/status 101) (place-image (text "landed" 14 "red")
                                  30 20 
                                  (render 101)))

(define (render/status y)

      [(<= 0 y CLOSE)
        (text "descending" 14 "green")]
      [(and (< CLOSE y) (<= y HEIGHT))
        (text "closing in" 14 "yellow")]
      [(> y HEIGHT)
        (text "landed" 14 "red")])
