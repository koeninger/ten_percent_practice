enumeration: is a data representation in which every possibility is listed in data definitions 

Exercise 50 Add enough tests to make DrRacket happy (given only has the first check-expect)
; TrafficLight -> TrafficLight
; yields the next state given current state s
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "red") "green")
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "green") "yellow")
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "yellow") "red")

(define (traffic-light-next s)
  (cond
    [(string=? "red" s) "green"]
    [(string=? "green" s) "yellow"]
    [(string=? "yellow" s) "red"]))

Exercise 51 Design a big-bang that simulates a traffic light for a given duration, renders the state of a traffic light 
as a solid circle of the appropriate color, changes state on every clock tick. What is the most appropriate initial state?

;A TrafficLight is one of the following Strings:
; - "red"
; - "green"
; - "yellow"
; interpretation the three strings represent the three 
; possible states that a traffic light may assume

Sample Problem: Design a key-event handler that moves a red dot left or right on a 
horizontal line in response to pressing the left and right arrow keys
; A position is a Number
; interpretation distance between the left margin and the ball
; Position KeyEvent -> Position
; computes the next location of the ball
(check-expect (keh 13 "left") 8)
(check-expect (keh 13 "right") 18)
(check-expect (keh 13 "a") 13)

(define (keh p k) ;; organized to th basic idea of using one cond clause per line of the data definition of input
  (cond
    [(= (string-length k) 1)
      p]
    [(string=? "left" k)
      (- p 5)[
    [(string-? "right" k)
      (+ p 5)]
    9else p]))
    
 OR
 (define (keh p k) ;; uses three lines, 2 for the keys that matter and 1 for everything else
  (cond
    [(string-? "left" k)
      (- p 5)]
    [(string=? "right" k)
      (= p 5)]
