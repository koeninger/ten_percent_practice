enumeration: is a data representation in which every possibility is listed in data definitions 

Exercise 50 Add enough tests to make DrRacket happy (given only has the first check-expect)
; TrafficLight -> TrafficLight
; yields the next state given current state s
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "red") "green")
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "green") "yellow")
(check-expect (traffic-light-next "yellow") "red")

(define (traffic-light-next s)
  (cond
    [(string=? "red" s) "green"]
    [(string=? "green" s) "yellow"]
    [(string=? "yellow" s) "red"]))

Exercise 51 Design a big-bang that simulates a traffic light for a given duration, renders the state of a traffice light 
as a solid circle of the appropriate color, changes state on every clock tick. What is the most appropriate initial state?

;A TrafficLight is one of the following Strings:
; - "red"
; - "green"
; - "yellow"
; interpretation the three strings represent the three 
; possible states that a traffic light may assume 

; Physical Constants
(define W-WIDTH 100)
(define W-HEIGHT 80)

; Graphical Constants
; TrafficLight -> Image
; given state s, return color light
; Traffic-Light -> TrafficLight
; produce the next traffic light state
; TrafficLight -> Image
; render the traffic light 
; TrafficLight -> TrafficLight
; start the world with (main "yellow") to start red.
