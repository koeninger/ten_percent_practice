Sample problem: design a program that launches a rocket when the user of your program 
presses the space bar. The program first displays the rocket sitting at the bottom
of the canvas. Once launched, it moves upward at three pixels per clock tick

; An LR (short launching rocket) is one of:
; - "resting"
; - NonnegativeNumber
; intepretation "resting" represets a ground rocket 
; a number denotes the height of a rocket in flight
--- interpretation of numbers is ambiguous in its notion of height:
  1. height could refer to the distance between the gorund and the rocket's point of reference
  2. the distance between the top of the canvas and the reference point 
  
Exercise 53 solve the exercises using the first interpretation of height
draw some world scenarios and to represent them with data and pick some data examples 
and to draw pictures that match them, do so for the LR definition including at least 
HEIGHT and 0 as examples 

; physical constants
(define HEIGHT 300)
(define WIDTH 100)
(define YDELTA 3) 

; grahpical constants
(define BACKG (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define ROCKET (rectangle 5 30 "solid" "red")) 
(define CENTER (- HEIGHT (/ (image-height ROCKET) 2))) 

; A LR (short for launching rocket) is one of: 
; - "resting"
; - nonnegative number
; intepretation "resting" represets a ground rocket 
; a number denotes the height of a rocket in flight 

; An LRCD (for luanching rocket countdown) is one of: 
; - "resting" 
; - a Number between -3 and -1
; - a NonnegativeNumber
; intepretation a grounded rocket, in countdown mode,
; a number denotes the number of pixels between the 
; top of the canvas and rocket (its height) 
(check-expect (show "resting") (place-image ROCKET 10 HEIGHT BACKG))
(check-expect (show -2) 
                (place-image (text "-2" 20 "red") 
                  10 (* 3/4 WIDTH) 
                  (place-image ROCKET 10 HEIGHT BACKG)))
(check-expect (show 53) (place-image ROCKET 10 53 BACKG))

; LRCD -> Image
; redners the state as a resting or flying rocket 
(define (show x) 
  BACKG)

; LRCD KeyEvent -> LRCD
; starts the countdown when space bar is pressed,
; if the rocket is still resting
(define (launch x ke) 
  x)

; LRCD -> LRCD
; raises the rocket by YDELTA, 
; if it is moving already
