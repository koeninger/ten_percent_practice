It is now clear that programmers must create data definitions for all but the simplest problems

Sample Problem: Design a function that computes the distance of objects in a 3-dimensional space to the origin. 
1. When a problem calls for the representation of pieces of information that belong together
or describe a natural whole, you need a structure type definition. A data definition for st
a structure type intoduces a name for the collection of instances that are legitimate.
Use only names of built-in data collections or previously defined data definitions.
Data definitions should come with data examples: 

(define-struct r3 [x y z])
; An R3 is a structure: 
;     (make-r3 Number Number Number)
(define ex1 (make-r3 1 2 13)) 
(define ex2 (make-r3 -1 0 3)) 

2. need a signature, purpose statement, and a function header but they remain the same

;R3 -> Number
; produces the distance from p to origin
(define (r3-distance-to-0 p) 0) 

3. Use examples to create functional examples 
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 ex1)) 13.19 0.01)
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 ex2)) 3.162 0.01)
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 (make-r3 1 1 5))) 5.196 0.01)  

4. add a selector for each field to the templates for such function 

(define (r3-distance-to-0 p)
  (... (r3-x p) ... (r3-y p) ... (r3-z p) ...)) 
  
5. use the selector expressions from the template to define the functions 
(define (r3-distance-to-0 p)
  (sqrt
   (+
    (sqr (r3-x p))
    (sqr (r3-y p))
    (sqr (r3-z p)))))
6. Test. 
(define-struct r3 [x y z])
; An R3 is a structure:
; (make-r3 Number Number Number)
(define ex1 (make-r3 1 2 13))
(define ex2 (make-r3 -1 0 3))

;R3 -> Number
; produces the distance from p to origin
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 ex1)) 13.19 0.01)
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 ex2)) 3.162 0.01)
(check-within (inexact->exact (r3-distance-to-0 (make-r3 1 1 5))) 5.196 0.01)
(define (r3-distance-to-0 p)
  (sqrt
   (+
    (sqr (r3-x p))
    (sqr (r3-y p))
    (sqr (r3-z p)))))
    
Exercise 80 create templates for functions for functions that consume instances 
of the following structure types, do not need data definitions for this task 

(define-struct movie [title director year])

(define (fn-for-movie m)
  (... (... (movie-title m))
       (... (movie-director m))
       (... (movie-year m)))) 
(define-struct pet [name number])

(define (fn-for-pet p) 
  (... (... (pet-name p))
       (... (pet-number p)))) 
       
(define-struct CD [artist title price])

(define (fn-for-CD c) 
  (... (... (CD-artist c))
       (... (CD-title c)) 
       (... (CD-price c)))) 
       
(define-struct sweater [material size color])

(define (fn-for-sweater s)
  (... (... (sweater-material s)) 
       (... (sweater-size s)) 
       (... (sweater-color s)))) 

Exercise 81 Design the function time->seconds, which consumers instances of time structures
(exercise 77) and produces the number of seconds that have passed since midnight. 
example: representing 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 2 seconds with one of these structures and 
if you then apply time->seconds to this instance, the correct result is 45002

(define-struct TIME [hours minutes seconds])
; TIME is (make-TIME Number Number Number)
; uses a 24 hour clock 
; interpretation a point in time containing an hour, minute and seconds 

(define TIME1 (make-TIME 3 30 30)) ; 3:30:30 am
(define TIME2 (make-TIME 13 30 0)) ; 1:30:00 pm

(define SECONDS-HOUR 3600)
(define SECONDS-MINUTE 60)

; Time -> Number
; consumes a time structure and produces the number of seconds that have passed since midnight 
(check-expect (TIME->SECONDS (make-TIME 0 0 0)) 0)
(check-expect (TIME->SECONDS TIME1) 12630)
(check-expect (TIME->SECONDS TIME2) 48600)

(define (TIME->SECONDS t)
  (+ 
    (* SECONDS-HOUR (TIME-hours t))
    (* SECONDS-MINUTE (TIME-minutes t))
    (TIME-seconds t))) 
    
Exercise 82 Design the function compare-word. The functions consumes two three-letter words (exercise 78). Produces a word that 
indicates where the given ones agree and disagree. The function retains the content of the structure fields if the two agree
otherwise it places #false in the field of the resulting word. Hint The exercise mentions two tasks: 
the comparison of words and the comarison of "letters"

; A Lower Case Letter (or LCL) is one of:
; 1String [a,z]
; #false
; interpretation lower case letters, a through z, or no letter 

(define-struct 3L-WORD [letter1 letter2 letter3]
; 3L-WORD is a (make-3L-WORD LCL LCL LCL) 
; interpretation 3L-WORD consists of three lower case letters 

(define WORD (make-word "a" "c" "t"))
(define WORD1 (make-word "c" "a" "t"))
