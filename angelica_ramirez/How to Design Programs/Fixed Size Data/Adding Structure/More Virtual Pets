Exercise 88 Define a strucutre type that keeps track of the cat's x-coordinate and its happiness. 
Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed VCat, including an interpretation 

(define-struct vcat [x-pos happy])
; A cat-status is a structure
;      (make-vcat Number Number)
; interpretation (make-vcat n k) describes a cat's
; x-coordinate and its happiness level

(define CAT1 (make-vcat 0 100) ; happy cat at origin
(define CAT2 (make-vcat 100 0) ; unhappy cat at x-coordinate 100
(define CAT3 (make-vcat 50 50)

Exercise 89 Design the happy-cat world program, which manages a walking cat and its happiness level. 
Let's assume that the cat starts out with perfect happiness
Hint1 Reuse the functions from the world programs in Virtual Pet Worlds
Hint2 Use structure type from the preceding exercise to represent the state of the world 

(define-struct vcat [x-pos happy])
; A cat-status is a structure
; (make-vcat Number Number)
; interpretation (make-vcat n k) describes a cat's
; x-coordinate and its happiness level

(define CAT1 (make-vcat 0 100))
  
(define CAT2 (make-vcat 100 0))
  
(define CAT3 (make-vcat 50 50))
