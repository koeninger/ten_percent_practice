Exercise 88 Define a strucutre type that keeps track of the cat's x-coordinate and its happiness. 
Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed VCat, including an interpretation 

(define-struct vcat [x-pos happy])
; A cat-status is a structure
;      (make-vcat Number Number)
; interpretation (make-vcat n k) describes a cat's
; x-coordinate and its happiness level

(define CAT1 (make-vcat 0 100) ; happy cat at origin
(define CAT2 (make-vcat 100 0) ; unhappy cat at x-coordinate 100
(define CAT3 (make-vcat 50 50)
