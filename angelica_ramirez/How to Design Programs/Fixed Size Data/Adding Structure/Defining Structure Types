a strucutre type definition defines many functions simultaneiously, it defines three kinds of functions: 
 - a constructor, function that creates structure instances 
 - selector, extracts the value of the field from a structure instance
 - structure predicates, distinguishes instances from all other kinds of values 
 
 Exercise 65: writes down the names of the functions (constructors, selectors, and predicates) that each introduces
