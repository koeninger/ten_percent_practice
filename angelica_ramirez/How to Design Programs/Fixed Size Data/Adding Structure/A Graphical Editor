Exercise 84 Design edit. Consumes two inputs, an editor ed and a KeyEvent ke, produces
another editor. Task is to add a single-character KeyEvent ke to the end of pre field of ed,
unless ke denotes the backspace "\b" key. In that case, it deletes the character immediately
to the left of the cursor (if there are any). The function ignores the tab key "\t" and 
return key "\r". Pays attention to only two KeyEvents longer than one letter: "left" 
and "right" Left arrow moves the cursor one character to the left if any, and the right
arrow moves it one character to the right if any. All other KeyEvents are ignored. 

Auxilary functions needed string-first, string-rest, string-last, string-remove-last
