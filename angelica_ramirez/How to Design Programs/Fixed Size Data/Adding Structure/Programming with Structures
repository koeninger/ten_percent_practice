Exercise 72 Formulate a data definition for the above phone stucture type definition 
that accommodates the given examples. Formulate a data definition for phone numbers 
using this structure type definition: (define-struct phone# [area switch num])

(define-struct phone [area number])
; A phone is a structure: 
; (make-phone Number String)
; interpretation (make-phone area number)
; area the area code
; number the phone-number

(make-phone 512 "555-5555") 

(define-struct phone# [area switch num])
; A phone# is a structure:
; (make-phone# Number Number Number)
; interpretation (make-phone# area switch num)
; area the area code 
; switch is the phone switch (exchange) of neighborhood
; number is a Number in the neighborhood

(make-phone# 512 363 2421) 

Exercise 73 team is designing an interactive game program that moves a red dot 
across a 100 x 100 canvas and allows players to use the mouse to reset the dot 

(define MTS (empty-scene 100 100))
(define DOT (circle 3 "solid" "red")) 

; A Posn represents the state of the world 

; Posn -> Posn
(define (main p0)
  (big-bang p0
    [on-tick x+]
    [on-mouse reset-dot]
    [to-draw scene+dot]))
    
; Posn -> Image
; adds a red spot to MTS at p
(check-expect (scene+dot (make-posn 10 20))
              (place-image DOT 10 20 MTS)) 
(check-expect (scene+dot (make-posn 88 73))
              (place-image DOT 88 73 MTS)) 
              
(define (scene+dot p) 
  (place-image DOT (posn-x p) (posn-y p) MTS))
  
; Posn -> Posn
; increases the x-coordinate of p by 3
(check-expect (x+ (make-posn 10 0)) (make-posn 13 0))

(define (x+ p)
  (make-posn (+ (posn-x p) 3) (posn-y p)))
