<a href="https://www.website.com">Website</a>
<a opening tag
href (reference) is the attribute
attributes describes the properties of elements

Format: 
a space between a and href
no spaces around the =
website has 2 " around it 
no spaces between href attribute and > of the opening tag

Quiz: type in a link that points to https://www.google.com and displays as Google

<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

IMAGES <img> as the element
<img src="http://www.website.com/image.jpg" alt=alternative description">
source attribute src 
since hosted online "http://www."
alt important for people who use screen readers to browse the web 
images do not need closing tags (called void elements)

A GUIDE TO PATHS 
path is a way of describing where a file is stored, local and external paths 
example of a local: /Users/Cameron/Documetns/file.txt 
Absolute path to index.html: 
  file:///Users/Cameron/Udacity/CD/fend/fend-refresh/index.html (when opening in browser)
External paths: use servers that run software that exposes the files from the web, using external paths 
different protocols, most common are HTTP and HTTPS
Relative paths: similar to absolut paths but describes how to find a path to a file form a directory that is not the root directory 
  they work the same for both local and external paths 
External path: 
  <a href="http://labs.udacity.com/fend/example/hello-world.html">Hello, world!</a>
Local path: 
  <a href="/Users/cameron/Udacity/etc/labs/fend/example/hello-world.html">Hello, world!</a>
both are links to the same file using absolute paths 
  /fend/example/hello-world.html mean the same thing 
relative path: example/hello-world.html
if you are editing /Users/cameron/Udacity/etc/labs/fend/test.html
you can reference hello-world.html by describing how to get from it's location in fend/ to hello-world.html 
  takes advantage that test.html and example/ are in the same directory 
  
  If editing a file in /Users/cameron/Udacity/etc/labs/ and want to write path to hello-world.html
    relative path: fend/example/hello-world.html 
2 files: 
  http://labs.udacity.com/science/sciences.html
  http://labs.udacity.com/science/physics/relativity.html
  
  in order to write relative path from sciences.html to relativity.html, will need to include the path that describes hwo to get 
  from science/ to relativity.html
    <a href="phsyics/relativity.html">Einstein's Special Relativity</a>
    
FIGURES

Exercise: need to edit index.html so that caption displays below the image
use a relative path to the image, which is going to be in the same directory as index.html
1. create a <figure> element
2. add an <img> element whose src attribute points to the provided image 
3. add an alt attribute to the image
4. add a <figcaption> element with the text for the image's caption
5. change the markdown code to a real HTML link 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
  <!--
  You'll see some text written like this below: [words that are displayed](http://website.com). This is Markdown syntax for a link. You can think of Markdown as HTML shorthand. You'll need to turn it into HTML that looks like <a href="http://website.com">words that are displayed</a>.

  <!-- Turn this into HTML! -->
  <figure>
    <img src="redwoods_state_park.jpg" alt="Redwoods state park">

        <h1>Hottest Jobs in 2016 #2: Web Developer</h1>

        <p>By <strong><em>Cristopher Watkins</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>January 19, 2016</p>

        <img src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.udacity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Slack-for-iOS-Upload.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=320%2C168" alt="Hottest Jobs in 2016 #2: Web Developer">

        <p>There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience â€¦ the web. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the web would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job. Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and lots of users means lots of demand. LOTS of demand. ðŸ”¥
