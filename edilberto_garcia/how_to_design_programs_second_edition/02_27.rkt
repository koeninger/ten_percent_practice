; Exercise 27. Our solution to the sample problem contains several constants in the middle of functions.
; As One Program, Many Definitions already points out,
; it is best to give names to such constants so that future readers understand where these numbers come from.
; Collect all definitions in DrRacketâ€™s definitions area and change them so that all magic numbers are refactored into constant definitions.
