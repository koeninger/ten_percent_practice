; Exercise 34. Design the function string-first,
; which extracts the first character from a non-empty string.
; Donâ€™t worry about empty strings.

; 1) We use Strings to represent text, and 1String to represent a character
; 2)
;    - signature: String -> 1String
;    - statement of purpose: Computes the first character from a string
;    - header: (define string-first a-string)  "a")
; 3) Functional examples
;    - given : test, expect: t
;    - given : Pizza, expect: P
;    - given : 8675309, expect: 8
; 4) Take inventory: data is given through parameters
; 5) Code 
     (define (string-first str)(string-ith str 0))
; 6) Test
      (string-first "test")
      (string-first "Pizza")
      (string-first "8675309")
