; Exercise 53. The design recipe for world programs demands that you
;    translate information into data and vice versa to ensure a complete
;    understanding of the data definition. Itâ€™s best to draw some world
;    scenarios and to represent them with data and, conversely, to pick
;    some data examples and to draw pictures that match them. Do so for
;    the LR definition, including at least HEIGHT and 0 as examples.
