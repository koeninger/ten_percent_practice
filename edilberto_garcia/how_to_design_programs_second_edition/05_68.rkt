; Exercise 68. An alternative to the nested data representation of balls uses four fields to keep track of the four properties:

(define-struct ballf [x y deltax deltay])

; Programmers call this a flat representation. Create an instance of ballf that has the same interpretation as ball1.


(make-ballf 30 40 -10 -5)

; that would be analogous to 
;(define ball1
;  (make-ball (make-posn 30 40) (make-vel -10 5)))
