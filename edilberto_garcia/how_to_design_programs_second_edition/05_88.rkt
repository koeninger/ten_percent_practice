; In this section we continue our virtual zoo project from Virtual Pet Worlds. Specifically, the goal of the exercise is to combine the cat world program with the program for managing its happiness gauge. When the combined program runs, you see the cat walking across the canvas, and, with each step, its happiness goes down. The only way to make the cat happy is to feed it (down arrow) or to pet it (up arrow). Finally, the goal of the last exercise in this section is to create another virtual, happy pet.



; Exercise 88. Define a structure type that keeps track of the catâ€™s x-coordinate and its happiness. Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed VCat, including an interpretation.
