; Exercise 39. Good programmers ensure that an image such as CAR can be
;  enlarged or reduced via a single change to a constant definition.
(define WHEEL-RADIUS 10)

;The definition of WHEEL-DISTANCE is based on the wheelâ€™s radius.
(define WHEEL-DISTANCE (* WHEEL-RADIUS 5))

;  Hence, changing WHEEL-RADIUS from 5 to 10 doubles the size of the car image.
;  This kind of program organization is dubbed single point of control, and good
;  design employs this idea as much as possible.
;Develop your favorite image of an automobile so that WHEEL-RADIUS
;  remains the single point of control.
