# Ten Percent Practice

Continuous improvement is easier with practice.  Practice is easier when you are subject to clear expectations.

As a member of HYFN Local engineering, you are expected to spend ten percent of your time at work practicing to improve yourself as a programmer.

## Ten Percent Time
By ten percent of your time, we mean:

- Pick one hour per workday.
- Missing one day of practice per week is expected, missing an entire week is not.
- Turn off distractions, including Slack and your email client.  If there's an actual emergency, someone will physically find you or call your phone.

## Practice
By practice, we mean:

- Writing code to solve problems from books or online courses, and checking it in
- Translating code from a language you know well to one you don't (or vice versa)
- Helping someone else who is stuck on a practice problem

Practice does **not** mean:

- Just reading or watching a video without solving any problems
- Copying code examples
- Doing someone else's work for them

## Checking in code
We want everyone to practice on their own interests, but also be able to see others' work, so we're using a single master branch:

- Make a folder in the root with your name.
- Pick a book or course, make a subfolder named after it.
- Add a readme.md in the subfolder with enough information for someone else to find the book / course.
- Check in code at least once per practice session.

There's no need for a pull request unless you're modifying this document.

## Feedback
Ask for help.  Feel free to read what other people are working on and ask questions.

Do not force unsolicited help. Do not criticize.

## Resources
We will help you get access to the resources you need, whether that's buying physical books, a Safari digital books account, or online course fees, up to $500/year.  Talk to your manager.

## Suggested starting points

If you do not have a formal computer science background:

- [How to Design Programs 2e](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/) or the [First Edition](http://www.htdp.org/).  Yes, it's pitched at a highschool level, but is very well written and tested with students.

If you do not have experience with a reasonably modern statically typed language:

- [Creative Scala](https://gum.co/creative-scala)
- [Essential Scala](https://gum.co/essential-scala)
