Chapter 1: Processing Simple Forms of Data
1: Languages needed to communicate information and instructions to computers
Data - information expressed in a programming Languages
Atomic data - letters, numbers
Compound data - made up of smaller pieces of Data
instructions = operations
primitive operations - add, subtract, multiply, etc.  - words of the language
programs - combined primitive operations - forming sentences with the words

2: Scheme - (+ 5 5) function, then order of numbers (/8 12)
  Scheme allows nesting of expressions (* (+ 2 2) (/ (* (+ 3 5) (/ 30 10)) 2)) = 48
   (sqrt A) (expt A B) (remainder A B) (log A) (sin A)
  circle area calculation: (define (area-of-disk r)
  (* 3.14 (+ r r)))
  (define (area-of-disk r)
  (* 3.14 (* r r)));
(area-of-disk 5) = 78.5

//area of ring calculation
(define (area-of-disk r)
  (* 3.14 (* r r)))
(area-of-disk 5)
(define (area-of-ring outer inner)
  (- (area-of-disk outer)
  (area-of-disk inner)))
(area-of-ring 5 3)
