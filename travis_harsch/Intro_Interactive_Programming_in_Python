Week 2
Functions in Python
# computes the area of a triangle (comment out what it does)
def triangle_area(base, height):     # header - ends in colon (define name of function, then inputs/parameters)
    area = (1.0 / 2) * base * height # body - all of body is indented (same level of indention - indicates end of function)
    return area                      # body - return outputs value (return = output)
functions only executed when called
function as a box - takes inputs, creates output - names exist only within functions
   calling the function

single-input function
# converts fahrenheit to celsius
def fahrenheit2celsius(fahrenheit):
    celsius = (5.0 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32)
    return celsius

# test
   c1 = fahrenheit2celsius(32)
   c2 = fahrenheit2celsius(212)
   print c1, c2

#function within a function
# converts fahrenheit to kelvin
def fahrenheit2kelvin(fahrenheit):
    celsius = fahrenheit2celsius(fahrenheit)
    kelvin = celsius + 273.15
    return kelvin

# test
k1 = fahrenheit2kelvin(32)
k2 = fahrenheit2kelvin(212)
print k1, k2

#better to use existing functions instead of recalculating - fix one error instead of several

# prints hello, world!
def hello():
    print "Hello, world!"
#function without a return value
#python - value of none - shows up when there's no return statement

# test
hello()      # call to hello prints "Hello, world!"
h = hello()  # call to hello prints "Hello, world!" a second time
print h      # prints None since there was no return value
