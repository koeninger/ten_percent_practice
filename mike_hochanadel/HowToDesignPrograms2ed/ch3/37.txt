;Exercise 37. Design the function string-rest , which produces a string like the
; given one with the first character removed.
Recipe steps:
1.
We need a string that is a string in BSL that is like the given string but with
the first 1String  character removed.
2.
; string-rest will take in a string and return a string with the 1st character
; removed
3.
; 'String' => 'tring'
; '42' => '2'
; '' => ''
4.
(define (string-rest str)
  string)
5.
; string-rest will take in a string and return a string with the 1st character
; removed
; 'String' => 'tring'
; '42' => '2'
; '' => ''
(define (string-rest str)
    (if (> (string-length str) 0)
      (substring str 1 (string-length str))
      ""
    ))
