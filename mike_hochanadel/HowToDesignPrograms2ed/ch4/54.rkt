; An LRCD (for launching rocket countdown) is one of:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
; interpretation a grounded rocket, in countdown mode,
; a number denotes the number of pixels between the
; top of the canvas and the rocket (its height)

; the state of the LRCD when resting is any type of value that is not a Number or negative Number
; the label itself is "resting" and if thinking in intervals any string type would be like a open
; ended bracket for all strings
