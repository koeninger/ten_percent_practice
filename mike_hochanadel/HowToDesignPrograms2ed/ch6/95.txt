For the first SIGS, the structures created match what is required for the first itemization documented in the SIGS data definition.  A UFO is a Posn and a tank takes two numbers.  That's what is created and then passed as an argument for the SIGS structure.
The second SIGS follows much like the first one where the required structures are there for the 3 structures needed for the second SIGS data itemization.  It is a Posn, tank, and Posn.  The interesting part here is the global variables used to denote the y coordinate of the missile.
The third is just like the second except the y coordinate is not in an initial state.
