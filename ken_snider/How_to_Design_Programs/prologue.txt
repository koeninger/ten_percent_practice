# One Program, Many Definitions

# Before you read on, ponder the following changes to your program:
# How would you change the program to create a 200-by-400 scene?
# How would you change the program so that it depicts the landing of a green UFO (unidentified flying object)? Drawing the UFO is easy:
#  (overlay (circle 10 "solid" "green")
#         (rectangle 40 4 "solid" "green"))
# How would you change the program so that the background is always blue?
#
# How would you change the program so that the rocket lands on a flat rock bed that is 10 pixels higher than the bottom of the scene? Donâ€™t forget to change the scenery, too.
