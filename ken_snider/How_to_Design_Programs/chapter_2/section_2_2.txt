;Exercise 21. Use DrRacket’s stepper to evaluate (ff (ff 1)) step-by-step. Also try (+ (ff 1) (ff 1)). Does DrRacket’s stepper reuse the results of computations?

(define (ff a)
  (* 10 a))

DrRacked appears to calculate each step, as evidenced by it making the same calculation twice in stepping through (+ (ff 1) (ff 1)).

;Exercise 22. Use DrRacket’s stepper on this program fragment:
;(define (distance-to-origin x y)
;  (sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y))))
;(distance-to-origin 3 4)
;Does the explanation match your intuition? 

Yes - DrRacket evaluates the first viarable in the most-nested parenthesis first (x), followed by the second (y), then steps down and evaluates the next set of parenthesis in the function.
