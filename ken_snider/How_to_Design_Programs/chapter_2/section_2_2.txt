;Exercise 21. Use DrRacket’s stepper to evaluate (ff (ff 1)) step-by-step. Also try (+ (ff 1) (ff 1)). Does DrRacket’s stepper reuse the results of computations?

(define (ff a)
  (* 10 a))

DrRacked appears to calculate each step, as evidenced by it making the same calculation twice in stepping through (+ (ff 1) (ff 1)).
