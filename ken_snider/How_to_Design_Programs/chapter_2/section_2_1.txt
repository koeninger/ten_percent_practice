;Exercise 11. Define a function that consumes two numbers, x and y, and that computes the distance of point (x,y) to the origin.
;In exercise 1 you developed the right-hand side of this function for concrete values of x and y. Now add a header.

(define (fdist x y) (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))

;Exercise 12. Define the function cvolume, which accepts the length of a side of an equilateral cube and computes its volume. If you have time, consider defining csurface, too.

(define (cvolume x) (expt x 3)) 
(define (csurface x) (* 6 (expt x 2)))

;Exercise 13 Define the function string-first, which extracts the first 1String from a non-empty string.

(define (string-first x) (= (string-length x) 1))
