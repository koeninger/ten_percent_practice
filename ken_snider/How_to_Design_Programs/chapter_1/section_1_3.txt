;Exercise 3. Add the following two lines to the definitions area:
;(define str "helloworld")
;(define i 5)
;Then create an expression using string primitives that adds "_" at position i. In general this means the resulting string is longer than the original one; here the expected result is "hello_world".
;Position means i characters from the left of the string, but programmers start counting at 0. Thus, the 5th letter in this example is "w", because the 0th letter is "h".

(define str "helloworld")
(define i 5)

(string-append (substring str 0 i) "_" (substring str i)) 

; ---

;Exercise 4. Use the same setup as in exercise 3 to create an expression that deletes the ith position from str.

(define str "helloworld")
(define i 5)

(string-append (substring str 0 (- i 1)) (substring str (+ i 1)))
