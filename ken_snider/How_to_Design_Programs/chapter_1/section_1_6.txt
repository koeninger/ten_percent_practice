;Exercise 8. Add the following line to the definitions area:

; (define cat <image>)
; (<image> used to represent cat image here)

; Create a conditional expression that computes whether the image is tall or wide. An image should be labeled "tall" if its height is larger than or equal to its width; otherwise it is "wide". 

(require 2htdp/image)
(define size
  (if
    (>= (image-height cat) (image-width cat))
    "tall"
    "wide"
  )
)

(string-append "The image is " size)

; Now try the following modification. Create an expression that computes whether a picture is "tall", "wide", or "square".

(require 2htdp/image)
(define size
  (if
    (= (image-height cat) (image-width cat))
    "square"
    (if
     (>= (image-height cat) (image-width cat))
     "tall"
     "wide"
     )
  )
)
