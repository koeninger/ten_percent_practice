; Exercise 83. Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.

(define-struct editor [pre post])
; An Editor is a structure:
;   (make-editor String String)
; interpretation (make-editor s t) describes an editor
; whose visible text is (string-append s t) with
; the cursor displayed between s and t

; Editor -> Image
; render displays the contents of Editor as an image
(check-expect (render (make-editor "pre" "post")) (overlay/align "left" "center"
     (beside
      (text "pre" 16 "black")
      (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
      (text "post" 16 "black"))
               (empty-scene 200 20)))
(define (render e)
  (overlay/align "left" "center"
     (beside
      (text (editor-pre e) 16 "black")
      (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red")
      (text (editor-post e) 16 "black"))
               (empty-scene 200 20)))
