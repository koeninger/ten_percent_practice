; Exercise 76. Formulate data definitions for the following structure type definitions:
; (define-struct movie [title producer year])
; (define-struct person [name hair eyes phone])
; (define-struct pet [name number])
; (define-struct CD [artist title price])
; (define-struct sweater [material size producer])
; Make sensible assumptions as to what kind of values go into each field.

; ---

; A Movie is (make-movie String String String)

; A Person is (make-person String String String Phone)
; where a Phone is (make-phone Number String)

; A Pet is (make-pet String Number)

; A CD is (make-CD String String String)

; A Sweater is (make-sweater String String String)

; Exercise 77. Provide a structure type definition and a data definition for representing points in time since midnight. A point in time consists of three numbers: hours, minutes, and seconds.

; ---

; A Timesince is (make-timesince Number Number Number)
(define-struct timesince [hh mm ss])

; Exercise 78. Provide a structure type and a data definition for representing three-letter words. A word consists of lowercase letters, represented with the 1Strings "a" through "z" plus #false.

; ---

; A Threeletterword is one of:
; - (make-threeletterword 1String 1String 1String)
; - #false
(define-struct threeletterword [ letter1 letter2 letter3 ])

; Exercise 79. Create examples for the following data definitions:
; A Color is one of: 	
; — "white"	
; — "yellow"	
; — "orange"	
; — "green"	
; — "red"	
; — "blue"	
; — "black" 

; H is a Number between 0 and 100.	
; interpretation represents a happiness value 

;(define-struct person [fstname lstname male?])	
; A Person is a structure:	
;   (make-person String String Boolean) 

;(define-struct dog [owner name age happiness])	
; A Dog is a structure:	
;   (make-dog Person String PositiveInteger H) 
; Add an interpretation to this data definition, too.

; A Weapon is one of: 	
; — #false	
; — Posn	
; interpretation #false means the missile hasn't 	
; been fired yet; a Posn means it is in flight
