; Exercise 54. Why is (string=? "resting" x) incorrect as the first condition in show? Conversely, formulate a completely accurate condition, that is, a Boolean expression that evaluates to #true precisely when x belongs to the first sub-class of LRCD.

; (define (show x)
;  (cond
;    [(string? x) ...]
;    [(<= -3 x -1) ...]
;    [(>= x 0) ...]))

; (string=? "resting" x) would be incurrect because x is a representation of LRCD, which is an Itemization that includes:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
;
; Numbers are not strings and would be errors to this function.

; A more useful expression would be:
(and (string? x) (string=? x "resting"))
