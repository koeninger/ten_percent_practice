; Exercise 54. Why is (string=? "resting" x) incorrect as the first condition in show? Conversely, formulate a completely accurate condition, that is, a Boolean expression that evaluates to #true precisely when x belongs to the first sub-class of LRCD.

; (define (show x)
;  (cond
;    [(string? x) ...]
;    [(<= -3 x -1) ...]
;    [(>= x 0) ...]))

; (string=? "resting" x) would be incurrect because x is a representation of LRCD, which is an Itemization that includes:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
;
; Numbers are not strings and would be errors to this function.

; A more useful expression would be:
(and (string? x) (string=? x "resting"))

; Exercise 55. Take another look at show. It contains three instances of an expression with the approximate shape:
(place-image ROCKET 10 (- ... CENTER) BACKG)

;This expression appears three times in the function: twice to draw a resting rocket and once to draw a flying rocket. Define an auxiliary function that performs this work and thus shorten show. Why is this a good idea? You may wish to reread Prologue: How to Program. 

; Number -> Image
; Renders the rocket images based on the output of show
(check-expect (place-rocket 0) (place-image ROCKET 10 (- 0 CENTER) BACKG))
(check-expect (place-rocket 42) (place-image ROCKET 10 (- 42 CENTER) BACKG))
(define (place-rocket x)
  (place-image ROCKET 10 (- x CENTER) BACKG))

; === (WIP)

(define HEIGHT 300) ; distances in pixels 
(define WIDTH  100) ; distances in pixels
(define YDELTA 3)
 
(define BACKG  (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define ROCKET (rectangle 5 30 "solid" "red"))
 
(define CENTER (/ (image-height ROCKET) 2))

; An LRCD (for launching rocket countdown) is one of:
; – "resting"
; – a Number between -3 and -1
; – a NonnegativeNumber 
; interpretation a grounded rocket, in countdown mode,
; a number denotes the number of pixels between the
; top of the canvas and the rocket (its height)

; Number -> Image
; Renders the rocket images based on the output of show
(check-expect (place-rocket 0) (place-image ROCKET 10 (- 0 CENTER) BACKG))
(check-expect (place-rocket 42) (place-image ROCKET 10 (- 42 CENTER) BACKG))
(define (place-rocket x)
