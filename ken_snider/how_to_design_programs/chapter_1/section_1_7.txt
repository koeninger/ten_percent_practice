;Exercise 9. Add the following line to the definitions area of DrRacket:
;(define in ...)
; Then create an expression that converts the value of in to a positive number. For a String, it determines how long the String is; for an Image, it uses the area; for a Number, it decrements the number by 1, unless it is already 0 or negative; for #true it uses 10 and for #false 20.

(define in ...)

(if
 (string? in)
 (string-length in)
 (if
  (image? in)
  (* (image-height in) (image-width in))
  (if
   (number? in)
   (if
    (positive? in)
    (- in 1)
    in)
   (if
    (boolean? in)
    (if
     (false? in)
     20
     10)
    "Invalid input")
  )
 )
)

; Exercise 10. Now relax, eat, sleep, and then tackle the next chapter.
